TASKS ALREADY COMPLETED (or assumed completed before failure or new information discovery):
{completed_tasks_summary}

PENDING/CANCELLED TASKS FROM ORIGINAL PLAN (due to failure or new information discovery):

INITIAL STATEMENTS ABOUT THE WORLD:
{world_statements}

INSTRUCTIONS:
Generate a new sequential list of tasks to recover from the failure or new information and achieve the original goals.
The new tasks should pick up from the current state after the failure.
The first task in your new sequence should have empty 'dependency_task_ids'.
Subsequent tasks should list dependencies based on the zero-based index of tasks *in your new sequence*.
Ensure all original goals are addressed by the combination of already completed tasks and your new task list.
